# Detection-of-Muscle-Fatigue-using-NN
Goal: Use CNN to detect fatigue before it happens and suggest adaptive muscle training.
Most systems only detect fatigue after it occurs. Our model can forecast fatigue levels and optimize workouts or physicalÂ therapy.
In the first review, we have got the command to know more about the dataset which we use and about the sensor that we use.
February 3rd to 4th week- We worked on the prototype model of our project 
March 1st and 2nd week- We were preparing the code for our model
